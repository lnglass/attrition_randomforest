# attrition_randomforest
Predicting employee attrition using a Random Forest model in R, with SMOTE resampling, threshold tuning, SHAP explanations, and performance visualizations. 

---

## Project Summary

This project builds a classification model to predict employee attrition using the `attrition` dataset from the `modeldata` package. The workflow includes:

- **Data cleaning & preprocessing**
- **SMOTE** to address class imbalance
- **Random Forest** with parameter tuning to mitigate overfitting
- **Model evaluation** via ROC, PR curves, and threshold tuning
- **SHAP explanations** for model interpretability
- **Interactive Shiny app** to explore threshold-performance tradeoffs
- **Contour risk plot** visualizing risk zones by tenure and salary

---

## Key Findings

- SMOTE increased the model's sensitivity but required careful tuning to avoid overfitting.
- Lowering the classification threshold (e.g., 0.15) improved recall for identifying "quitting" employees.
- Salary and tenure were the strongest predictors of attrition.
- The modelâ€™s test AUC was approximately 0.69, indicating modest generalizability.
